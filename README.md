## About the Project
"Becoming an AI Designer" is an open-source initiative aimed at bridging the gap between traditional digital design disciplines (UI, UX, Service) and the emerging field of AI design. This project serves as a living resource for digital designers to become AI-aware and evolve into proficient AI designers.

## Why It Matters
As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly integral to digital products, the need for designers who understand AI's capabilities, limitations, and design implications grows. However, transitioning from a traditional design background to a role that includes AI design is not straightforward. This project seeks to demystify AI for designers, offering them the tools, knowledge, and confidence to innovate within this space.

## What You Will Find
The project is divided into several key sections, each designed to progressively upskill participants:

- Introduction to AI for Designers: Understand the basics of AI and how it applies to digital design.
- Tools and Technologies: Get hands-on with the tools and technologies that make AI design possible.
- Case Studies and Best Practices: Learn from real-world applications and the frontiers of AI design.
- Projects and Exercises: Apply your knowledge through practical projects and exercises.
- Community and Collaboration: Join a community of like-minded individuals, share your work, and collaborate on innovative solutions.
