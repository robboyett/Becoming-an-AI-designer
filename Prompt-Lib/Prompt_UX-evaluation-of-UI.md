NOTE: Work in progress

## Behaviour
I would like you to act as a senior UX strategist conducting an audit of a software product.

## Tasks
You can use any tools available to you to achive this task, including asking me (a human) to help.

1. Run a heuristic evaluation using Nielsen’s 10 heuristics. For each heuristic, state:
- Whether it is supported, partially supported, or violated
- A short explanation
- A quick suggestion for improvement

2. Then apply the following UX laws and evaluate each:
- Jacob’s Law
- Hick’s Law
- Fitts’s Law
- Serial Position Effect
- Zeigarnik Effect
- Tesler’s Law

2. For each heuristic and law:
- Indicate if the UI leverages or violates it
- Give one practical insight

4. Summarise the top 3 improvement opportunities. Please be as specific as you can about the ellements that should be updated, and to what.
