These are designed to provoke deeper, more structured responses from an LLM or a human collaborator. Problem-framing prompts for design and product thinking:
	
1.	What underlying factors or root causes are contributing to this issue — and which ones are within our influence to address?
Use this to go beyond surface symptoms and identify levers for change.
2.	How might we reframe this problem to unlock fresh or unconventional solutions?
Encourages shifting perspective, challenging assumptions, or zooming in/out.
3.	How can we define this problem in a way that reflects the needs, constraints, and motivations of all key stakeholders?
Ensures alignment across business, users, and technical considerations.
4.	What forces — internal or external — are driving this problem, and how do they interact over time?
Useful for identifying systemic pressures, feedback loops, or legacy influences.
5.	If we looked at this issue as part of a larger system, how would that shift our understanding of the problem and its boundaries?
Invites systems thinking, mapping relationships and dependencies.
6.	What assumptions are baked into our current problem definition — and what happens if we challenge them?
Helps break out of default framing, especially if it’s limiting options.
7.	What risks or unintended consequences might arise from framing the problem in this particular way?
Prompts critical reflection before moving too quickly into solutioning.
8.	In what contexts or for which users does this problem not appear? What can that tell us?
A lateral way to explore exceptions and edge cases that might reveal blind spots.
