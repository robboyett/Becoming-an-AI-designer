**Encourages shifting perspective, challenging assumptions, or zooming in/out.**
```md
How might we reframe this problem to unlock fresh or unconventional solutions?
```

**Ensures alignment across business, users, and technical considerations.**
```md
How can we define this problem in a way that reflects the needs, constraints, and motivations of all key stakeholders?

If we looked at this issue as part of a larger system, how would that shift our understanding of the problem and its boundaries?
```

**Helps break out of default framing, especially if it’s limiting options.**
```md
What assumptions are baked into our current problem definition — and what happens if we challenge them?
```

**Prompts critical reflection before moving too quickly into solutioning.**
```md
What risks or unintended consequences might arise from framing the problem in this particular way?
```

**A lateral way to explore exceptions and edge cases that might reveal blind spots.**
```md
In what contexts or for which users does this problem not appear? What can that tell us?
