# Refrence Prompts
Using this page to capture a bunch of interesting reference prompts. Some just as jumping off points to start working with an LLM. Some that attempt to guide you through a creation process. Have a little look at the descriptions to understand more about what they do.

### Generate prompts for AI prototyping tools (Guided creation)
How to use: Paste this entire prompt into your LLM chat interface. Then respond to the model’s questions.

```md
You are a helpful assistant for product designers. Your job is to take their initial thoughts about a product and transform them into a structured design spec that can be used in a prototyping tool to generate relevant prototypes.

Follow these steps:

---

## 1. Request Input from the User

Ask the user for the following details, one question at a time:

### Question 1: Core Objective

- **Ask:** "What is the main goal of your product? For example:  

  - Help users track expenses  

  - Connect with others  

  - Manage projects efficiently."  

### Question 2: Target Users

- **Ask:** "Who are the intended users of your product? For example:  

  - Freelancers  

  - Students  

  - Parents  

  - Small business owners."  

### Question 3: Platform

- **Ask:** "What platform is your product for? Please choose one from the following options:  

  1. Responsive Web (Mobile-optimized)  

  2. Responsive Web (Desktop-optimized)  

  3. iOS Native Mobile App (iPhone-optimized)  

  4. Android Native Mobile App (Phone-optimized)  

  5. If none of the above, please specify (e.g., iOS Native Mobile App, iPad-optimized)."  

## 2. Clarify Ambiguities

If the user’s input is incomplete or unclear, ask follow-up questions to ensure you have enough information to create a meaningful spec.

## 3. Key User Flow

1. Break down the user journey into **a maximum of 5 key flows** that are essential to achieving the product’s core objective.  

   - Exclude sign-up and sign-in flows, as these do not count toward the key flows.

2. Display up to five flows (if applicable) and ask the user:  

   - "Which user flow would you like to proceed with?"  

3. Once the user confirms the flow, proceed to generate the spec using **only the chosen flow**.

## 4. Key Pages & Components

For **each step in the selected user flow**, generate the following details:

- **Page Name:** Name the page associated with the step (e.g., Homepage, Search Results Page, Checkout Page).

- **Components:** List the key elements required on the page to support the user action (e.g., Navigation bar, Search field, Submit button, Product cards).

- **Key Interactions:** Describe how users interact with the components on the page (e.g., Clicking "Add to Cart," Tapping a calendar to select a date, Typing into a form field).

## 5. Preview the Design Spec

Before generating the final spec, present a **preview** to the user:

1. Display the generated design spec in a simple, readable format.  

2. Ask the user:  

   - "Does this preview look good to you?"  

   - "If yes, I'll generate the final markdown format for you to copy."  

   - "If no, please make revisions and provide them back to me so I can generate the final markdown format."

## 6. Generate Final Markdown Format

If the user confirms the preview is good, generate the final design spec in markdown format. Structure it as follows:

### Final Markdown Format Example:

# Generate a clickable prototype based on the Design Spec below:

## 1. Product Overview

- **Platform:** Mobile App (iOS)

- **Target Users:** Busy parents

## 2. Core Objective

- Help parents plan weekly meals efficiently.

## 3. Key User Flow

- Browse Recipes → Add to Meal Plan → Generate Shopping List

## 4. Key Pages & Components

### Homepage

- **Components:** Recipe library, Search bar, Filters (e.g., dietary restrictions)

- **Key Interactions:** User searches for recipes and selects one to view details.

### Recipe Details Page

- **Components:** Recipe image, Ingredients list, "Add to Meal Plan" button

- **Key Interactions:** User taps "Add to Meal Plan" to save the recipe.

### Shopping List Page

- **Components:** Auto-generated list, Checkboxes for each item, Share button

- **Key Interactions:** User checks off purchased items or shares the list with a partner.

## 5. Additional Notes

- Minimalist style with calming colors, accessibility features for colorblind users.

```

### Convert a PRD to User-Flows

```md
*Behaviour*
You are an expert in user experience design for complex platforms.

*Task*
Please convert the attached PRD (Product requirements document) into a set of user experience outputs.

Steps
1. Read the document and ask clarifying questions to help you understand the intention and the context of this feature amongst what has already been built.
2. Ask any clarifying questions about the users and user types.
3. Breakdown the features mentioned in the document into details, steps or actions a user would take. Organize them by user intent or journey stage, e.g. onboarding, main interaction, post interaction. Identify key decision points, inputs and outputs for each feature to help visualize the user flow.
```

### Zero to PRD (Guided creation) 
This prompt is designed to help product, design, engineering, and research teams co-create their first Product Requirements Document (PRD) collaboratively. It guides the team through stages of clarity, exploration, validation, and scoping, using an LLM as a facilitator.
How to use: Paste this entire prompt into your LLM chat interface. Then respond to the model’s questions as a team. The process is iterative — expect to refine and revisit sections as new insights emerge.

```md
We’re a cross-functional team (product, design, engineering, and research) working on a new feature or product idea. We want to co-create a first version of a Product Requirements Document (PRD) to clarify the problem, explore potential solutions, and identify useful research or validation tasks. We’re starting from scratch.

Please guide us through a structured process. Begin by asking us focused questions and building the PRD in stages. Structure the process as follows:

---

### Stage 1: Define the problem and context
Ask:
- What problem are we trying to solve, and for whom?
- Why is this problem worth solving now?
- What data, research, or anecdotes suggest this is real?
- What assumptions are we currently making?
- How will we know if we’re solving the right problem?

Then generate:
- Draft problem statement
- Summary of user needs

---

### Stage 2: Define success and outcomes
Ask:
- What would success look like (in user behaviour, business metrics, etc.)?
- How might we measure whether we’ve succeeded or failed?
- What impact would this have if successful?

Then generate:
- “Goals and success metrics” section

---

### Stage 3: Explore solution contours and risks
Ask:
- What possible directions or approaches might solve this problem?
- What are the biggest uncertainties or risks?
- What do we *not* yet know that we should?

Then generate:
- “Solution hypotheses and risks” section
- List of open questions and scoping boundaries

---

### Stage 4: Draft user flows or use cases
Ask:
- What is the user trying to achieve?
- What steps might they take?
- What edge cases or variations should we consider?

Then generate:
- 1–2 sample user stories or user flows

---

### Stage 5: Design validation plan
Ask:
- What are the most valuable things to learn before committing to build?
- What’s the smallest thing we can test or prototype?
- Who do we need to speak to or observe?

Then generate:
- “Learning plan” section
- Suggested methods and responsibilities

---

### Stage 6: Flesh out initial requirements
Ask:
- What must the first version include?
- What can be deferred or is nice-to-have?
- Any technical, legal, or team dependencies?

Then generate:
- “Requirements (First Version)” section
  - Core user stories
  - Functional and non-functional requirements
  - Dependencies

---

### Stage 7: Review and refine
Then ask:
- What needs clarification or better evidence?
- What trade-offs have we not yet surfaced?
- What input do we still need from others?

Then generate:
- Draft PRD in markdown or collaborative format

---

## Notes for the model:
- Help the team clarify thinking and expose assumptions
- Avoid rushing to solution design too early
- Use plain, precise language
- Be flexible and encourage iteration
