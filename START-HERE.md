# Becoming an AI designer
A set of resources and a structure for upskilling from one of the ‘traditional’ digital design roles (UI, UX, Service) towards becoming AI aware, and on to be an AI designer.

## Fragmentation of design titles across the last 20 years

- [ ] Roles have been fragmented and reinvented over the last 20 years. We have an opportunity to do more with less and harness the designer spirit
- [ ] Over the last two decades, as my career has progressed, I've found it fascinating to watch the integration of new skills and disciplines into digital design. These have been dissected, separated, classified, and moulded into distinct roles. For instance, upon my arrival in London, I joined an agency called ustwo, where we initially had digital designers and animators. However, over time, UX design emerged as a distinct discipline. Initially, this division, which segregated what we now refer to as visual designers, UI designers, and interaction designers from the problem-solving aspect, seemed misguided. Nonetheless, the separation occurred, with many individuals firmly establishing their identities within these new roles and moving forward. From ustwo, the evolution continued, leading to the introduction of titles like service designers and design researchers, spreading further and enticing professionals to transition to the latest designations. This trend posed challenges for companies attempting to build internal capabilities, as understanding the roles of these varied specialists became increasingly difficult. The advent of design ops aimed to address some of these challenges by clarifying the responsibilities and shaping the career paths for these roles, which, until then, lacked defined career trajectories or a set of universally accepted skills. This journey through the complexities of digital design indicates a period ripe for a reorganisation, aiming to broaden the scope while focusing on the skills essential for businesses.

## Selling in the AI designer role
AI needs to be designed. Human experiances need humans to carft them. Once we've defined the role of an AI designer, we're essentially pushing against an open door, thanks to Silicon Valley's extensive efforts to promote the value of AI in large organisations. The primary obstacle in introducing an AI designer role within any organisation echoes a longstanding challenge: advocating for the importance of the human experience and its often intangible contribution to revenue generation. Certain organisations, already advanced in recognising this value, will readily embrace this new role. Others, prioritising optimisation and time savings, may find it more difficult to appreciate its significance. Identifying a strategy to successfully implement this role within any organisation is a crucial initial step.

## Designing with AI
Solo or Together — how will we work with AI in our design practice?
“One of the first things I began to realise about AI is how great it is at developing average skills of almost anything. This is perfect when you are dealing with quantitative problems. If you give the average Egyptologist a hieroglyphic translation challenge* the chances are that you will get the right answer. I would guess only the bottom 10% would get the wrong answer, not enough to mess up the average. This is great, but it does not translate to more qualitative, creative problems. If you get the average musician on Spotify to write a song, the chances are really high that it is going to be a flop. 90% of streams on Spotify come from the top 1% of artists.”
