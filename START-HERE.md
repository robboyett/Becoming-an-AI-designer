# Becoming An AI Designer

A set of resources for upskilling from one of the ‘traditional’ digital design roles (UI, UX, Service) towards becoming AI aware, and on to be an AI designer.

- AI in Design Tools (Plugins): Modern UI design apps are gaining AI features. For example, Figma has community plugins like Magician that can generate icons or copy from prompts, and suggest design variations. These plugins act like an “AI pair designer,” helping automate parts of the workflow (layout suggestions, dummy text, image fills). Similarly, Framer introduced an AI site builder that turns a prompt into a quick webpage, and Webflow added AI-assisted code generation for custom elements. While official docs and community forums are the best resources for these (e.g. Figma’s plugin documentation for Magician), they deserve a spot in your hub (“AI-Assisted Design Tools”) as practical extensions: designers can try them to instantly populate designs with AI-generated content or even one-click prototype a webpage.

# AI-assisted coding for creative prototyping
AI tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Claude can help designers generate functional code snippets to accelerate prototyping. You can use natural language prompts to produce HTML/CSS, React components, or interactive sketches. This works especially well with tools like:

- p5.js – A JavaScript library for creative coding. Ask ChatGPT to generate p5.js sketches for data visualisations, interactive animations, or custom UI behaviour.
- ML5.js – A library that wraps common machine learning models into beginner-friendly JS functions. Combine it with ChatGPT to write code for real-time classification or generative effects in the browser.
- CodePen & Replit – Use AI to generate prototypes and then test and iterate in live environments.

### No-code machine learning in prototyping
Designers can explore machine learning behaviours in prototypes today using visual, no-code tools:

- Teachable Machine by Google – Train models using your webcam, voice, or image inputs. These models can be exported and embedded into prototypes to create gesture-driven, audio-reactive, or image-responsive interactions.
- Wekinator – Use real-time input data (e.g. from sliders, webcams, sensors) to train a model and trigger outputs. You can connect this to creative coding environments like Processing or Unity.
- Runway ML – Offers drag-and-drop access to powerful generative models for video, image, or text – useful for building experimental creative interfaces.
