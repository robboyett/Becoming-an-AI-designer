## Fragmentation of design titles across the last 20 years
Topics to cover
- [ ] Roles have been fragmented and reinvented over the last 20 years. We have an opportunity to do more with less and harness the designer spirit
- [ ] Over the last two decades, as my career has progressed, I've found it fascinating to watch the integration of new skills and disciplines into digital design. These have been dissected, separated, classified, and moulded into distinct roles. For instance, upon my arrival in London, I joined an agency called ustwo, where we initially had digital designers and animators. However, over time, UX design emerged as a distinct discipline. Initially, this division, which segregated what we now refer to as visual designers, UI designers, and interaction designers from the problem-solving aspect, seemed misguided. Nonetheless, the separation occurred, with many individuals firmly establishing their identities within these new roles and moving forward. From ustwo, the evolution continued, leading to the introduction of titles like service designers and design researchers, spreading further and enticing professionals to transition to the latest designations. This trend posed challenges for companies attempting to build internal capabilities, as understanding the roles of these varied specialists became increasingly difficult. The advent of design ops aimed to address some of these challenges by clarifying the responsibilities and shaping the career paths for these roles, which, until then, lacked defined career trajectories or a set of universally accepted skills. This journey through the complexities of digital design indicates a period ripe for a reorganisation, aiming to broaden the scope while focusing on the skills essential for businesses.
