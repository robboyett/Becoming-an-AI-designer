# AI-assisted coding for creative prototyping
AI tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Claude can help designers generate functional code snippets to accelerate prototyping. You can use natural language prompts to produce HTML/CSS, React components, or interactive sketches.

## Example Prompts
ADD

## Existing libraries to take advantage of
- p5.js – A JavaScript library for creative coding. Ask ChatGPT to generate p5.js sketches for data visualisations, interactive animations, or custom UI behaviour.
- ML5.js – A library that wraps common machine learning models into beginner-friendly JS functions. Combine it with ChatGPT to write code for real-time classification or generative effects in the browser.

## No-code machine learning in prototyping
Designers can explore machine learning behaviours in prototypes today using visual, no-code tools:

- Teachable Machine by Google – Train models using your webcam, voice, or image inputs. These models can be exported and embedded into prototypes to create gesture-driven, audio-reactive, or image-responsive interactions.
- Wekinator – Use real-time input data (e.g. from sliders, webcams, sensors) to train a model and trigger outputs. You can connect this to creative coding environments like Processing or Unity.
- Runway ML – Offers drag-and-drop access to powerful generative models for video, image, or text – useful for building experimental creative interfaces.
