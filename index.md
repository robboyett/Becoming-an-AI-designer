## Mindset Change
Advice from [Buzz Usborne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/buzz/) for any designer getting started

1. **Tool, not an outcome.**
    - Consider AI as infrastructure (like electricity: invisible, powerful, and everywhere). AI is not the work, it's what powers it.
    - AI gives you first drafts. Craftsmanship is what happens next.
2. **AI won’t replace designers. But designers who use AI well might replace those who don’t.**
    - Be curious, play, break things, try the hot new tool. Lean into discomfort. Explore why you dislike or love AI.
3. **Lean on qualities that AI does exceptionally well (like unbiased thinking and data interpretation) and use those to compliment (not replace) your skills.**
    - Consider AI as a thought-partner; use it to challenge assumptions, make ideas more robust and pull you from dead-ends.
    - Give AI a face; An art director, a researcher, a concept artist. Never you.
    - Be aware that using AI atrophies one’s ability to think critically, but improves cognitive bias. AI can make you more accurate, but less thoughtful.
4. **Make time to dwell in the unknown, to write and re-write, sketch and be confused. Maintain space to understand a problem more deeply.**
    - AI cannot produce the unexpected, illogical, magical or delightful. These are the parts that humans do well, and look for in great work.
    - "Writing is the process by which you realize that you do not understand what you are talking about. Importantly, writing is also the process by which you figure it out.”
5. **AI presents an opportunity for unexpected creativity. If you consider AI as a turbo-charge to get to 80% completion, then it puts a much higher burden on (and opportunity for) designers to go above and beyond for weird and creative execution.**

<a name="multimodal-ai-design-patterns"></a>
### Multimodal AI Design Patterns

Multimodal AI systems can process and respond to multiple input/output modes simultaneously, combining text, voice, vision, audio, and video. This enables more natural, accessible, and context-aware interactions. When to use multimodal: when you need to reduce cognitive load (voice input while hands are busy), increase accessibility (multiple input methods), or provide richer context (vision + text together). Design considerations include modality selection (when to use voice vs. text vs. visual), input fusion (combining multiple inputs), and graceful degradation (fallback when one modality fails).

- Design Patterns: Multimodal interaction patterns often involve context-aware modality selection. Use voice for hands-free tasks, visual for spatial understanding, text for precision. See existing pattern libraries above for multimodal examples.
- Voice Interaction Design: When integrating voice, consider feedback patterns (how users know the system is listening), error recovery (what happens when speech isn't understood), and privacy (visual indicators for when audio is being processed).
- Cross-modal Patterns: Combine modalities for richer experiences: visual search + voice query, image analysis + text description, video understanding + text transcription.
- Accessibility Considerations: Multimodal design increases accessibility by offering alternative input methods. Ensure all core functionality works with each modality independently.

<a name="ai-agents-and-agentic-ux"></a>
## AI Agents & Agentic UX

Agentic UX refers to interfaces where AI agents act autonomously on behalf of users, making decisions, taking actions, and adapting over time. Unlike simple chatbots or assistants, agentic interfaces are proactive, goal-oriented, and capable of complex multi-step tasks. Key design considerations include: user control (how to interrupt, override, or steer agent behavior), transparency (making agent thinking and decisions visible), and trust (designing systems that are understandable and helpful). This becomes especially important when agents operate across multiple tools or have persistent memory.

- Related: See [Designing Contextual Affordance](Designing-Contextual-Affordance.md) - Context management techniques relevant to agent design, including system prompts, memory, and tool selection
- User Control and Override Patterns: Design clear ways for users to interrupt agent actions, adjust autonomy levels, and provide feedback. Consider visual indicators for agent state (thinking, acting, waiting for input).
- Agent Transparency Patterns: Show what the agent is doing and why. Expose decision paths, tool usage, and reasoning steps. Balance transparency with cognitive load.

<a name="creative-ideation-and-refinement"></a>
## Creative ideation and refinement

AI excels at generating variations and unexpected connections, making it a powerful tool for ideation. Unlike traditional ideation, AI's variability becomes an asset. Each generation can reveal serendipitous features and alternative approaches you might not have considered. This is particularly valuable for the "matchmaking" approach: matching AI capabilities (even at moderate performance) with user needs to find low-effort, high-impact, buildable ideas.

- AI Brainstorming Design Kit, by HCI Institute https://aidesignkit.github.io/ - Framework that distills AI capabilities into eight core functions (Estimate, Forecast, Compare, Detect, Identify, Discover, Generate, Act). Offers a matchmaking approach to ideation that starts with AI capabilities rather than complex user pain points, leading to more buildable concepts.

<a name="iterative-testing-and-feedback"></a>
## Iterative testing and feedback

Testing AI experiences requires different approaches than traditional UX testing. You're evaluating how well the system understands context, handles ambiguity, and recovers from errors, not just interface usability. Focus on testing prompt effectiveness, model behavior variations, and the latent interface (system prompts, memory, tools) as much as the visible UI.

- Prompt Testing Frameworks: Test different prompt structures to see how AI interpretations vary. See [Problem Framing](#problem-framing) section for structured prompt techniques.
- User Testing AI Interfaces: What's Different? AI responses vary, so testing requires multiple iterations and focusing on edge cases, ambiguity handling, and error recovery.
- Hallucination Detection: Watch for AI confidently presenting false information. Design for verification and correction patterns. See [Designing Contextual Affordance](Designing-Contextual-Affordance.md) for context management techniques.
- AI Evaluation Frameworks: Traditional usability metrics need adaptation for AI. Consider accuracy, relevance, and user control alongside task completion.

<a name="storytelling-and-presentation"></a>
## Storytelling and presentation

AI can accelerate presentation creation and help communicate complex AI concepts to stakeholders. Use AI to generate presentation content, but remember: the story and structure remain human-driven. When presenting AI features, focus on explaining capabilities, limitations, and user benefits rather than technical details.

- Using AI for presentation design: Leverage AI tools to generate slides, visuals, and content outlines, but craft the narrative and flow yourself
- Communicating AI concepts: Focus on user benefits, explain capabilities clearly, and be transparent about limitations. See [Mindset Change](#mindset-change) for framing AI as infrastructure.
- Storytelling frameworks for AI products: Explain what AI enables, not just what it does. Connect features to user outcomes and business value.

<a name="cost--token-management"></a>
## Cost & Token Management

Understanding token usage and costs is crucial when working with AI models, especially for prototyping and production workflows. Tokens are the basic units of text that models process. Both input and output consume tokens. Costs scale with token usage, so optimizing prompts and managing context length directly impacts expenses.

**Decision Framework:**
- **Cloud vs. Local:** Use cloud models for rapid prototyping, experimentation, and when you need the latest models. Use local models for data-sensitive work, cost control at scale, or when you need predictable costs.
- **Context Length:** Longer context windows (e.g., Claude 3.5 Sonnet's 200K tokens) enable richer prompts but cost more. Use shorter context for simple tasks.
- **Model Selection:** Different models have different pricing. Some optimize for speed (cheaper) vs. quality (more expensive). Match model capability to task complexity.
- **Token Efficiency:** Reuse system prompts, batch requests when possible, and structure prompts to minimize repetition. See [Prompt writing](#prompt-writting) section for optimization techniques.

**Resources:**
- Token Counting Tools: Use online token counters or API tools to estimate costs before running prompts
- Cost Calculators: Most providers offer pricing calculators on their websites. Estimate costs based on input/output token counts
- Monitoring Usage: Set up usage alerts and track token consumption patterns to identify optimization opportunities
- Local Model Considerations: Local models (LLaMA, Deepseek) eliminate per-token costs but require hardware resources. Useful for high-volume use cases or sensitive data.
