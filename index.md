# 🧑‍🎨 Becoming An AI Designer

A set of resources for upskilling from one of the ‘traditional’ digital design roles (UI, UX, Service) towards becoming AI aware, and on to be an AI designer.


# 🏁 Getting Started With AI

## Mindset Change
Advice from [Buzz Usborne](https://www.linkedin.com/in/buzz/) for any designer getting started

1. **Tool, not an outcome.**
    - Consider AI as infrastructure — like electricity: invisible, powerful, and everywhere. AI is not the work, it’s what powers it.
    - AI gives you first drafts. Craftsmanship is what happens next.
2. **AI won’t replace designers. But designers who use AI well might replace those who don’t.**
    - Be curious, play, break things, try the hot new tool. Lean into discomfort. Explore why you dislike or love AI.
3. **Lean on qualities that AI does exceptionally well — like unbiased thinking and data interpretation — and use those to compliment (not replace) your skills.**
    - Consider AI as a thought-partner; use it to challenge assumptions, make ideas more robust and pull you from dead-ends.
    - Give AI a face; An art director, a researcher, a concept artist. Never you.
    - Be aware that using AI atrophies one’s ability to think critically, but improves cognitive bias. AI can make you more accurate, but less thoughtful.
4. **Make time to dwell in the unknown, to write and re-write, sketch and be confused — maintain space to understand a problem more deeply.**
    - AI cannot produce the unexpected, illogical, magical or delightful — these are the parts that humans do well, and look for in great work.
    - "Writing is the process by which you realize that you do not understand what you are talking about. Importantly, writing is also the process by which you figure it out.”
5. **AI presents an opportunity for unexpected creativity. If you consider AI as a turbo-charge to get to 80% completion, then it puts a much higher burden on (and opportunity for) designers to go above and beyond for weird and creative execution.**
