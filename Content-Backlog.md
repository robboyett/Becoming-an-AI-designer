AI Brainstorming Design Kit, by HCI Institute
https://aidesignkit.github.io/
Description:
I watched the presentation on creating design resources for ideating AI concepts, and it really clarified why so many AI products fail. The main issue is that we tend to design the **wrong thing**—designers over-envision AI, and data scientists miss user needs.

The research developed a resource that distills **what AI can do** into eight high-level capabilities: **Estimate, Forecast, Compare, Detect, Identify, Discover, Generate, and Act.**

The key takeaway for me is the shift in the ideation process. Traditional user-centered design often leads to ideas that require **near-perfect AI performance**, making them high-risk and unbuildable.

The more valuable approach is a **matchmaking process** that blends user and tech focus. Instead of starting with a complex pain point, we should:

1.  Review existing AI capabilities, especially those requiring only **moderate AI performance**.
2.  Actively look for user needs or situations where that *moderate* performance can still deliver value.

This led to generating ideas that are **low-effort, high-impact, and buildable**, effectively covering the often-missed part of AI's design space.

It’s a thoughtful framework with some genuinely interesting shifts in how we approach ideation, so I wanted to share a quick takeaway—sorry if this is the wrong thread for this stuff :slightly_smiling_face:
What stood out most to me is the reframing of the ideation process. Traditional user-centred design often leads to concepts that rely on perfect AI performance, ideas that are high-risk, fragile, and rarely buildable.
The AI Design Kit proposes a different starting point: a matchmaking approach. Rather than beginning with a complex user pain point, teams:
Review existing AI capabilities, focusing on those that perform reliably even at a moderate level.
Identify user needs or contexts where that moderate capability still creates clear value.
They argue, and to some extent are able to demonstrate that this shift tends to produce ideas that are low-effort, high-impact, and actually buildable. Helping designers explore the underused middle ground of AI’s design space.

AI Fluency: Framework & Foundations
https://anthropic.skilljar.com/ai-fluency-framework-foundations
Description:
About this course
At Anthropic, we believe that empowering people with AI, and ensuring that AI makes safe contributions to society, requires engaging with a wide range of human perspectives and experiences. Responsible AI development and engagement isn't something any single discipline or viewpoint can fully address. It demands collaborative approaches that span a wide range of technical, creative, business, scientific, and educational domains. That's why we partnered with educators who bring complementary expertise to create this foundational course on AI collaboration.

This course is the result of a long partnership between Anthropic and professors Rick Dakan from Ringling College of Art and Design and Joseph Feller from University College Cork. Rick and Joe developed the AI Fluency Framework in 2023-2024, based on their research exploring how AI tools like Claude were transforming creative and business processes. When we saw the framework, we immediately recognized a shared vision: helping people interact with AI effectively and responsibly, beyond just “cool prompts.” Their framework offered exactly the kind of multidisciplinary perspective we believe is essential for navigating AI’s impact on society.

The AI Fluency Framework they created — four interconnected competencies (Delegation, Description, Discernment, and Diligence) — enables more effective, efficient, ethical, and safe human-AI collaboration, regardless of which new AI models or tools emerge. We collaborated to develop this course based on their framework, bringing together our collective expertise in AI systems, education, creativity, and business innovation. The work was supported in part by the Higher Education Authority (Ireland) through the National Forum for the Enhancement of Teaching and Learning.

This framework has already informed undergraduate and postgraduate courses at both Ringling College and University College Cork, as well as staff training initiatives and community outreach events. Now, we’re excited to share these insights more broadly through this open online course.

Our goal is to make AI Fluency accessible and useful to everyone, no matter what stage of AI expertise you find yourself at. We hope you find it valuable in navigating the evolving landscape of AI collaboration.

A Visual Introduction To AI For Designers, by Berkley University
https://www.uxai.design
Description:
This resource was created to familiarize user experience (UX) designers with concepts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and provide tools that support a human-centered approach to designing explainable interfaces for AI products and services.

Design For AI, by IBM
https://www.ibm.com/design/ai/
Description:
To design for a relationship with AI, we need to know ourselves first. Our practice is built on IBM’s Principles for the AI Era as a resource for all designers and developers. This shared collection of ethics, guidelines, and resources ensures that IBM products share a unified foundation.

People + AI Research, by Google
https://pair.withgoogle.com/
Description:
People + AI Research (PAIR) is a multidisciplinary team at Google that explores the human side of AI by doing fundamental research, building tools, creating design frameworks, and working with diverse communities.

We believe that for machine learning to achieve its positive potential, it needs to be participatory, involving the communities it affects and guided by a diverse set of citizens, policy-makers, activists, artists and more.

NAME
https://aidesign.guide/
Description:
This actually has a lot of similarities to the work that I'm doing here with becoming an AI designer. Really great set of topics explored and links.
"Let’s explore what’s possible when design meets artificial intelligence.
This is a growing collection of no-fluff guides, workflows, prompts, and tools that are changing how designers work right now. ✨
Whether you’re building your first AI workflow or ready to automate half your design process, this gets updated weekly with stuff that actually moves the needle."
